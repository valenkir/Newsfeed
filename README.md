- Create an application in React;
- Use any CSS framework of your choice (Bootstrap, Bulma, etc.) or write your own styles;
- The application should be responsive and look good on mobile devices;
- Deploy the application on GitHub pages or web hosting;
- Optimize the application to have at least 85 points in PageSpeed Insights for both mobile and desktop.

Create an application with a news feed. Show the latest articles when the user opens the page. On the left (or right), the user can set filters before a new search, like a column of filters, which are common, for example, on sites selling equipment. Among the filters should be search by phrase, select category (5), and select country (5). Note that a filter can consist of both one and several filters at the same time.

The header of the application should contain a list of categories (available sources). By clicking on a category, download articles from it and display them on the page, such as "sports, finance, music". Upload 50 articles each time. Also, the user should be able to choose the application's theme â€“ dark or light. Think about the color scheme or analyze the existing palettes.
